# pulse-oximeter-and-human-body-temperature-dectector

#Description:-
We have used ESP32 microcontroller in this project.for detect heartbeat and percentage of oxygen
we used MAX30100 and for detecting temprature of we used LM35 sensor.these sensors are collect 
data from finger and send this data to ESP32.ESP32 sends data through wifi to blynk app and 
it will show current temprature of body and heartbeat as well.

idea implimentation:- 
we all khow high fever and problem in breathing are symptoms of corona virus.if heartbeat 
measured by sensor is greater than 95 so it will show in app and same with temprature if it
is greater than 37*c so app will indicate those values.

this simple device everyone can purchase or by health department easily survey door by door.
